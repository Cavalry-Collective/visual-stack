# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Visual Stack — a coding-agent plugin for interactive wireframing and UI review.
The user comments directly on a wireframe (or a running app) in a browser
workspace; the agent applies the feedback and publishes the next version into
the same workspace. The repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace
(`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) with one plugin, `plugins/vstack/`, which
also ships a Codex manifest (`.codex-plugin/`) and a Grok host adapter
(`skills/review/hosts/grok.md`).

**This repo is the thing people install; nothing is installed into it.** No
`.grok/skills/`, no `.claude/skills/`, no vendored copy of our own plugin — a
host that discovers skills from a project directory gets instructions in its
host adapter, not a checked-in skill directory that then has to be kept in sync.

Plain Node ≥ 18 ES modules, standard library only. There is no package.json,
build step, bundler, or linter. (`node_modules/` at the root appears only when
recording the README demo, which installs playwright-core.)

## Commands

Tests are standalone Node scripts — run them directly, one file per suite:

```bash
node plugins/vstack/skills/review/tests/review-lifecycle.mjs   # end-to-end review server round-trip
node plugins/vstack/skills/review/tests/host-profiles.mjs      # host profiles conform to host.schema.json
node plugins/vstack/skills/review/tests/workdir.mjs            # .vstack/local working-dir resolution
```

The shared UI shell is stamped into pages, not linked (see below):

```bash
node plugins/vstack/lib/build-shell.mjs stamp    # write lib/shell/ into every page
node plugins/vstack/lib/build-shell.mjs check    # exit 1 if any page has drifted
```

The manifests are validated by the same tool the community-marketplace review
pipeline runs:

```bash
claude plugin validate . --strict                # .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
claude plugin validate ./plugins/vstack --strict # the plugin manifest
```

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs all of the above on every pull request.

The security scans run in `.github/workflows/security.yml`, and a merge is
blocked until every one of them passes. Two of them run locally:

```bash
gitleaks git --no-banner --redact --verbose   # secrets, over the full history
uvx zizmor@1.29.0 .github/workflows/          # workflow audit
```

`SECURITY.md` owns what each gate enforces, the rule that a finding is fixed
rather than silenced, and the rule that every action is pinned by commit SHA
with its version in a trailing comment. Adding a step that uses an action means
resolving that SHA with
`gh api repos/<owner>/<action>/commits/<tag> --jq .sha`.

CI cannot install the plugin, so rehearse that locally before a release.
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` keeps it out of the real config: without it, a local-path
marketplace is written to user settings and shadows the published
`cavalry-collective` until it is removed. The source must be `./`, not `.`.

```bash
SANDBOX=$(mktemp -d)
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$SANDBOX/.claude claude plugin marketplace add ./
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$SANDBOX/.claude claude plugin install vstack@cavalry-collective
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=$SANDBOX/.claude claude plugin details vstack   # what a user sees
rm -rf $SANDBOX
```

Nothing above runs a review end to end. For that, load the plugin from disk and
drive the skill in a real project:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/vstack
```

## Architecture

### Contracts / engine / adapters / profiles

The layering rule that everything else follows (`plugins/vstack/contracts/README.md`):

- **Contracts** (`plugins/vstack/contracts/`) define what a coding-agent host
  must provide (`host.md`), the review protocol (`review-loop.md`), and the
  bridge protocol (`bridge-loop.md`). The engine and skills depend only on these.
- **The engine speaks contracts.** `review-server.mjs`, the workspace pages, and
  the shared shell never name a product (Claude, Codex, Grok) except as data
  from a Host profile.
- **Adapters speak hosts.** Only `skills/review/hosts/*.md` may mention
  host-specific tools (Monitor, Artifact, etc.). A SKILL.md references Host ops
  (`background`, `watch_stream`, `share`, …); the adapter maps them to tools.
- **Profiles are data.** `host-profiles/<id>.json` carries UI labels, install steps, and
  capability flags; servers inject it as `window.__VSTACK_HOST__`, selected by
  `--host` / `VSTACK_HOST` (default `claude`). Loaded via `lib/host.mjs`.
- **On-disk roles are stable:** review threads use `by: "agent" | "reviewer"`.
  Older files may say `"claude"`; readers treat that as `"agent"`.

### Two engines, one live-link protocol

- `skills/review/assets/review-server.mjs` — the wireframe review loop. Serves
  a self-contained HTML page inside the workspace, or reverse-proxies a running
  app (`--app`) so the workspace shares an origin with what it annotates (that
  origin-sharing is why comments can attach to elements, not coordinates). CLI
  subcommands (`publish`, `claim`, `reply`, `ack`, `share`, `status`,
  `check`, `watch`) drive the protocol; sentinels and round records live on disk.
- `lib/json-bridge.mjs` — the live link for JSON-document pages (user-story-map,
  plus the experimental spec and phase-build tools): the page POSTs saves and
  bumps a seq counter the agent's watcher wakes on; agent edits are pushed back
  over SSE.

Both share `lib/live-link.mjs`: a `watching` heartbeat file that says an agent
session is listening, atomic write-then-rename, and one protocol-wide staleness
constant — so the invariants can't drift between engines. Servers bind to
`127.0.0.1` only and close themselves when the browser tab goes away
(SSE idle timeout).

### Self-contained pages and the stamped shell

Every page (workspace, spec tree, story map, build board…) must work three
ways: served over http, opened off disk, and inlined into an Artifact under a
CSP that blocks all external requests. So nothing is linked at runtime — the
shared shell (`lib/shell/`: tokens, top bar, scrubber, `window.VSShell` /
`window.VSScrub`) is **copied into each page** by `lib/build-shell.mjs` between
`vstack:shell` markers. Edit `lib/shell/`, run `stamp`, commit both. Never
hand-edit a stamped region; page-specific controls go in `vstack:slot` blocks,
which survive stamping. New pages register in the `PAGES` list in
`build-shell.mjs`.

### On-disk state

Every tool writes per-machine state under `<root>/.vstack/local/<tool>/`
(gitignored via `**/.vstack/local/`); the rest of `.vstack/` (pipeline.json,
specs/, build/) is the pipeline and belongs in the repo. `lib/workdir.mjs`
resolves the directory — use it rather than joining paths by hand.

**Renaming a tool does not rename the directory it already filled.** `workdir.mjs`
keeps a `LEGACY` map of a tool's former directory names; `subjectDir()` reads a
subject from the first directory that holds it and creates new ones under the
current name, and `toolNames()` gives every name to callers that enumerate. Add
to `LEGACY` when you rename a tool — never migrate a user's rounds behind their
back. Review's rounds sat in `local/wireframe/` before the tool was renamed.

### Skills

Each skill is `plugins/vstack/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` plus `assets/` (the pages
and servers it runs). `review` is the primary tool and `user-story-map` ships
alongside it; `wireframe` is a compatibility entry that reads `review/SKILL.md`
and nothing else — it is what `review` used to be called. Engine
assets (`workspace.html`,
`review-server.mjs`, `bundle-artifact.mjs`) are never edited to fit a project —
only the page under review is.

`plugins/vstack/experimental/` holds the earlier project-planning tools (spec,
start, phase-build, phase-preview) and the retired `/vstack:go` alias in the
same `<name>/SKILL.md + assets/` shape. They are parked outside `skills/` on
purpose so no host discovers them as installable skills; their pages still
carry the stamped shell and are kept from drifting by `build-shell.mjs`.
Moving one back under `skills/` is the whole act of re-releasing it.

## Distribution and releases

This repo is what a stranger installs, so its public metadata is part of the
product. `claude plugin validate --strict` must pass on both manifests before
any change ships, because the community-marketplace review pipeline runs the
same check.

### Two host manifests, one identity

`plugins/vstack/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
`plugins/vstack/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` describe the same plugin to two
hosts, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` repeats the Claude entry.

- Change one manifest, change all three in the same commit.
- `version`, `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, and `keywords` are
  identical across them. Only the description's host name and the Codex
  `interface` block differ.
- Descriptions take their wording from `README.md`. The README is where the
  product's voice is decided; a manifest quotes it rather than inventing a
  second one.
- Keywords cover what someone would type to find this, not what it is built
  from. Do not add a keyword the description cannot back up.
- CI fails when the two host manifests declare different versions.

### Versioning

`version` is declared, so it is what a host compares against to decide an update
exists. **Pushing commits without bumping it ships nothing to anyone.**

- Bump `version` in both host manifests, and add the release to `CHANGELOG.md`,
  in the release commit.
- Tag `vX.Y.Z` on the commit that lands on `main`.
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` fails when the tag and the manifest disagree.
- MAJOR for a breaking change to a skill name, an on-disk path, or a protocol.
  MINOR for new behaviour. PATCH for a fix.
- Orphaning a user's in-flight state is MAJOR, and it needs a `LEGACY` entry in
  `lib/workdir.mjs` rather than a migration.
- `lib/update-check.mjs` mirrors the host's own update decision. It reads the
  declared `version` first and falls back to the install SHA only for a copy
  installed before a version existed. Changing how the version is declared means
  changing that file.

### Cutting a release when asked

When the user says to cut, ship, or publish a release, run this end to end. The
`main` ruleset requires a pull request, so nothing lands directly on `main`.

1. **Decide the version.** Read the commits since the last tag, apply the semver
   rule above, and tell the user the number you picked and why in one line.
   Proceed on that number. Stop and ask only when the same set of commits reads
   as either MINOR or MAJOR depending on how a breaking change is judged.
2. **Verify before proposing anything.** Run the tests, the shell check, both
   validate commands, and the install rehearsal from *Commands*. A failure here
   ends the release. Report it and fix it first.
3. **Branch.** `release/vX.Y.Z` off current `main`.
4. **Bump and record.** `version` in both host manifests, and a `CHANGELOG.md`
   entry written from the merged commits, newest first, with breaking changes
   called out.
5. **Open the PR.** Title `vX.Y.Z — <the release's one-line point>`. The body is
   the changelog entry, so it can be reused as the release notes.
6. **Watch CI.** `gh pr checks <number> --watch`. Every check must pass. A red
   check means fix it on the branch and watch again, never merge past it.
7. **Merge when green.** Squash. The user has standing approval for this merge
   and for the tag and release that follow, so do not ask again for a release
   they asked for.
8. **Tag `main`.** Pull the squashed commit, tag it `vX.Y.Z`, and push the tag.
   The release workflow re-checks the tag against the manifest.
9. **Publish the GitHub release** with the changelog entry as its notes, then
   give the user the release URL.

Stop and report rather than working around a problem: a red check that is not
yours to fix, a ruleset that rejects the merge, or a tag that already exists.

Nothing here is a dry run. Every step from 5 onward is public.

### Contributor-facing files

`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and this file state the
same rules to three audiences. A rule is owned by one of them and referenced
from the others. When a rule here changes and a contributor has to follow it,
update the PR checklist in the same commit.

## Coding standards

Keep cross-cutting concerns in shared modules, and keep `lib/` pure.
(Libraries-over-hand-rolling is a Principle below.)

- **Configuration.** All runtime config is read from the environment in one
  place and validated at startup against a declared schema, so a missing or
  malformed value fails fast with a clear, named error rather than misbehaving
  mid-request. No inner layer reads config directly — it is passed inward as
  values.

### Readability and Naming

Readable code is a review priority. A reviewer should understand intent from
names alone.

- Names are precise and state business meaning, not mechanics.
- No abbreviations unless standard in the domain or codebase. No misleading
  names. No single-letter variables outside trivial loop counters and
  conventional math.

#### Comments

- Comments explain **why** — the constraint, tradeoff, or external quirk behind
  the code — never what.
- Delete any comment that repeats what the code says.
- Notes to the reviewer ("fixed X here") go in the commit message, not in
  comments.

## Documentation style

Applies to every Markdown document in this repo.

- Write plain business English. Say it the way you would explain it to a
  colleague.
- Lead with the purpose. Open a document or section with why it exists, then
  drill into detail. Edge cases and notes go at the end.
- One idea per sentence. One rule per bullet. Prefer bullets and numbered lists
  over paragraphs. Use tables for reference material (keys, codes, bounds).
- Make a person or the system the subject.
- No slogans, no compressed abstractions. Contrast is fine when it prevents a
  mistake ("return 404, not 403"); drop it when it is only for effect
  ("assertions, not hopes").
- No em-dash chains or nested parentheticals. If a sentence needs more than one
  qualifier, split it.
- State rules imperatively. Rationale and rejected alternatives live in the
  document's designated notes/decisions section, never inline with the rule.
- No document history or meta-narration. Don't describe how the document came to
  be, what moved where, or what another file deliberately omits.
- State a rule once, in the document that owns it. Link to it from everywhere
  else.
- Exception: verbatim contract strings and copy-paste command blocks are never
  reworded for style.

## Principles (must follow)

Load-bearing engineering rules; honor them on every change. They are stack- and
tooling-agnostic.

- **Think before coding.** Don't assume, don't hide confusion, surface
  tradeoffs. State your assumptions and ask when uncertain; present multiple
  interpretations rather than silently picking one; suggest simpler alternatives
  and respectfully push back when warranted; stop and name what's confusing
  rather than proceeding on unclear requirements.
- **Simplicity first / YAGNI.** Write the minimum code that solves the problem.
  No unrequested features, no abstractions for single-use code, no
  configurability or error handling for cases that can't occur. "We might want
  it later" is not a reason. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite.
- **Change the right place, surgically.** First identify *where* a change
  belongs — the correct layer and boundary — and make it there; don't patch
  wherever is convenient. Then touch only what you must: match the surrounding
  style and conventions (error handling, logging, validation), don't reformat or
  refactor unrelated working code, flag unrelated dead code without removing it,
  and remove only the imports/variables your own change orphaned.
- **Goal-driven execution.** Define success criteria and loop until verified.
  Turn requests into measurable objectives with a brief plan and a verification
  step per phase, so each phase can iterate to a clear success marker. Verified
  means observed, not inferred: before calling a change done, run it and state
  the evidence you saw.
- **Don't reinvent existing solutions.** Use established libraries and project
  utilities for dates, money, validation, retry, pagination, parsing, and
  formatting rather than hand-rolling them — especially date/timezone math.
  Don't duplicate existing abstractions or wrap a library without a clear
  reason. Before adding a new dependency, confirm an existing dependency or
  shared util doesn't already cover it, and prefer well-maintained,
  widely-used, permissively-licensed packages. A trivial, stable one-liner
  doesn't earn a dependency — but dates, money, timezones, auth, and crypto
  always do; never hand-roll those.
- **Don't overfit to the immediate request.** Solve the general problem, not
  just the demonstrated case. Avoid hardcoding strings, IDs, statuses, roles, or
  regions; handle the empty, invalid, duplicate, retry, timeout, and permission
  cases, not only the happy path; and write tests that assert behavior rather
  than mirror the implementation.
- **Keep implementations clean, not mechanical.** No noisy logs, no broad
  `try/catch` that hides errors, no unused parameters or dead branches, no
  defensive code without a clear failure model. (Comment rules: *Readability and
  Naming*.)

## Demo recordings (README GIFs)

Use these dimensions for every demo recording — they were tuned so the text
reads clearly in the README:

- **Browser viewport 920 × 760**, and export the GIF at native resolution —
  never downscale the frames.
- **Review the demo page at phone width** (the workspace's 390px size) with the
  canvas zoom locked at 100%. The workspace refits zoom on every version load
  (size switch, Review changes, timeline scrub), so a recording script must
  pin it — set zoom to 1 and no-op the refit for the session.
- Keep the subject app trivially simple (the todo list works well) so the
  before/after change is obvious at a glance.
- Keep it snappy: fast typing, short holds, ~1.4× speedup at assembly, and
  clamp idle gaps (e.g. the round-trip wait) to ~0.5s.
- Target: ~12 seconds, under 1 MB, saved to `docs/assets/wireframe-demo.gif`.

Recordings are scripted — headless Chrome via playwright-core driving the real
review server end to end (publish v1, comment, send, claim, publish v2), with
frames captured as JPEGs and assembled with ffmpeg (two-pass palette).
