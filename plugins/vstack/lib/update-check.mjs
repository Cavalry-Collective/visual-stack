/*
 * update-check.mjs — "is there a newer Visual Stack than the one you are using?"
 *
 * The pages are self-contained and the servers are local, so nothing here can
 * be answered from inside the browser: an Artifact runs under a CSP that blocks
 * every external request, and a served page has no business reaching GitHub on
 * its own. The server asks instead, once, and hands the answer to the page it
 * serves — `window.__VSTACK_UPDATE__`, which the shell turns into one
 * dismissable line under the bar.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS NEWER
 * This asks the question the Host itself would ask, so the banner never
 * disagrees with what that Host's own update command would do. Each Host says
 * which question that is in `capabilities.updateDetect`, and each records an
 * install somewhere different:
 *
 *   claude-install  Claude Code keys its update decision on the plugin's
 *                   `version` when plugin.json declares one, and on the git
 *                   commit the plugin was installed from when it does not,
 *                   recording either in ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json.
 *   codex-install   Codex keeps no such record. It unpacks each release into
 *                   ~/.codex/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/,
 *                   so the directory the running copy sits in is the version
 *                   Codex resolved, and its presence is what proves an install.
 *   none            The Host has no install to compare. No banner.
 *
 * plugin.json declares a version, so the comparison is normally version against
 * version. A copy installed before that version existed has no version on
 * record, and falls back to the SHA behind it against the head of the default
 * branch.
 *
 * A working copy is not an install. Running from a clone (developing the plugin
 * itself) matches nothing, and the check returns nothing rather than telling you
 * your own uncommitted branch is out of date.
 *
 * What it does, exactly, so nothing here is a surprise:
 *   - one GET of a public GitHub endpoint, per server start, 2.5s timeout
 *   - the answer cached for six hours
 *   - fails silent: no network, a rate limit, a bad parse — the page is served
 *     exactly as it would have been, with no banner and no error
 *
 * Nothing is sent: no identifiers, no telemetry, no query. Set
 * VSTACK_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1 to skip it entirely.
