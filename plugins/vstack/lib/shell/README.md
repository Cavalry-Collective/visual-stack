# The shell

One top bar, one palette, one set of controls — for every page in the stack.

```
tokens.css    the palette, as roles: --paper --surface --ink --line --brand --ok …
              plus the dark ramp and the light/dark overrides
shell.css     the top bar and what sits in it: .btn .seg .sep .linkdot .banner
topbar.html   the bar itself — mark, page name, eyebrow, slots, theme, language,
              link dot, primary action
scrubber.css  the timeline control
scrubber.html its markup — a page opts in by carrying the marker
shell.js      window.VSShell (theme, language, link dot, live-link client,
              toast, two-step confirm, page name)
              window.VSScrub (the scrubber)
```

## Why it is stamped, not linked

These pages have to work three ways: served over http, opened straight off disk,
and inlined into an Artifact under a CSP that blocks every external request. A
`<link>` or a `<script src>` fails the third. So the shell is **copied into each
page** by `../build-shell.mjs`, between markers:

```bash
node lib/build-shell.mjs stamp     # write the shell into every page
node lib/build-shell.mjs check     # exit 1 if a page has drifted
```

Edit the files here, run `stamp`, commit both. Never hand-edit a stamped region
in a page — `check` will catch it, and the next `stamp` would overwrite it.

## What a page keeps

Layout, and anything that means something only there: the story map's phase
bands, the board's *new / have / touch*, the spec's priorities. Those live in
the page's own `:root` below the stamped block, with their own dark values.

Page controls go in a **slot**, and survive every stamp:

```html
<!-- vstack:slot tools -->     …before the theme and language switches
<!-- vstack:slot actions -->   …after them, where the primary action belongs
<!-- vstack:slot cog-settings -->  …in the settings menu, after language and before the version
<!-- vstack:slot cog -->        …at the foot of the settings menu, for actions such as a reset
```

## Using it from a page

```js
VSShell.init({ name: 'Spec', eyebrow: 'checkout', send: true });
VSShell.onLang(l => { LANG = l; render() });   // the switch is the shell's
VSShell.name('Phase 2 build');                 // when the page renames itself

// The live link, wired in one line. SSE when the server has an event stream —
// the shell owns onopen/onerror and the `presence` event; the page only hears
// its own events. A server that only answers a ping gets the poll form.
VSShell.connect({ url: `${BRIDGE.events}?t=${BRIDGE.token}`,
  on: { push: ev => apply(JSON.parse(ev.data)) },
  onLink: up => { S.linked = up } });
VSShell.connect({ poll: '/ping' });

// The dot's words are the shell's: bilingual, named after the host that
// window.__VSTACK_HOST__ says is listening. setLink(up, labels) still takes
// overrides, for a page with something more specific to say.
VSShell.setLink(true);

VSShell.toast(t('saved'));                     // one toast, styled once
VSShell.armConfirm($('#approve'), {            // press twice to mean it
  arm: paint, disarm: paint, onConfirm: send });
```

The scrubber is an ordered set of stops and a handle between them — versions on
the spec and the review workspace, release phases on `phase-preview`. The page
says what the stops are and what showing one does; the component owns the track,
the ticks, the drag and the caption (and escapes what it renders):

```js
VSScrub.mount({ onPick: id => show(id) });
VSScrub.set({
  items: versions.map(v => ({ id: v.n, cap: `v${v.n}`, label: v.label, sub: whenOf(v) })),
  active: viewing,
});
VSScrub.step(-1);   // what arrow keys bind to
```

`init` returns the API and is safe to call once, late — after the document the
page renders from has loaded. Language and theme are shared across every vstack
page in the browser (`vstack:lang`, `vstack:theme`), so a reviewer who works in
中文 gets 中文 on the next stage without asking twice.

Theme is three-state: **auto** (follow the OS), light, dark. Auto is the absence
of `data-theme`, which is also what an Artifact viewer's own toggle writes — so
the two never fight.
