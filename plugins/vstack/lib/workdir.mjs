/*
 * workdir.mjs — where a tool keeps its per-machine working files.
 *
 * One answer for every engine: `<root>/.vstack/local/<tool>/`. A project grows
 * one dot-directory instead of one per engine, and the split inside it is the
 * one that matters — `.vstack/local/` is this machine mid-flight and is
 * gitignored whole; everything else under `.vstack/` (pipeline.json, specs/,
 * build/) is the pipeline and belongs in the repo. Adding an engine costs no
 * new `.gitignore` line, and `local/spec/` can't be mistaken for `specs/`.
 *
 * `root` is the artifact's own directory, so state still sits beside the thing
 * it belongs to — a review of `design/login.html` lands in
 * `design/.vstack/local/review/login/`, and moving the page moves its review
 * with it. The one exception is an artifact that already lives inside a
 * `.vstack` directory: the spec tree writes `.vstack/specs/<feature>.json`, and
 * hanging `.vstack/specs/.vstack/` off it would nest the same name twice. When
 * the artifact is already under a `.vstack`, that one is used.
